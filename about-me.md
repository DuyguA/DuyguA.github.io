I'm a senior software engineer from Berlin, Germany. I'm a full stack NLP developer, I like to process the text beginning from corpus preparation until the statistical model. I hope you'll have good time in these pages. Please feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/duygu-altinok-4021389a).
